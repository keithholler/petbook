# PetBook

PetBook is an idea where people share their pets pictures and question. The unique feature is when you sign up you are mailed a special tag for their collar.
If they ever get lost you scan the NFC tag and you will be provided a unique id. The person can then submit the id online along with their phone number and 
let the owner know they found their pet with and email.

# Motivation
The mostivation behind this was to practice Redux while also homing in on my React Skills. One day I hope to make this site and idea tto life in the real world.
